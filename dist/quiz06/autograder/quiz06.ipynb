    "\n",
    "Basketball team managers would like to hire players who perform well but don't command high salaries.  From this perspective, a very crude measure of a player's *value* to their team is the number of 3 pointers and free throws the player scored in a season for every **\\$100000 of salary** (*Note*: the `Salary` column is in dollars, not hundreds of thousands of dollars). For example, Al Horford scored an average of 5.2 points for 3 pointers and free throws combined, and has a salary of **\\$28 million.** This is equivalent to 280 thousands of dollars, so his value is $\\frac{5.2}{280}$. The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\text{\"PTS\"} - 2 * \\text{\"2P\"}}{\\text{\"Salary\"}\\ / \\ 100000}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2.** Create a table called `full_data_with_value` that's a copy of `full_data`, with an extra column called `\"Value\"` containing each player's value (according to our crude measure).  Then make a histogram of players' values.  **Specify bins that make the histogram informative and don't forget your units!** Remember that `hist()` takes in an optional third argument that allows you to specify the units! Refer to the python reference to look at `tbl.hist(...)` if necessary.\n",
